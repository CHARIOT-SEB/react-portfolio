							I have always interested in computers, tech and the internet. When I left school in
							2011, I bought a MacBook Pro so that I could learn how to code.
							<br />
							<br />
							My first programming language was JavaScript and from there, everything just took off.
							After being completely self-taught for nearly two years, I decided to go on to study
							at Northcoders Bootcamp in Manchester. It was here where my career really took off as
							it gave me the foundations that would allow me to kickstart my developer career.
