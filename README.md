Welcome to my Portfolio!

When I original built this website it was way before I had began my bootcamp, so everything was built in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, however upon completion of my courseI had since come back to this and refactored everything into a react app.

It's still a work in progress but I'm really enjoying the creative freedom to getting to built my own web app. (plus I get to use as much yellow as I like, since it's the best colour in the world)
